Tutorials about libraries like image-js, ml-js, etc.

## Tutorial about image-classification

I've implemented recently a HOG descriptor for the library image-js. The tutorial shows how to use HOG descriptors for image classification. The dataset used is a dataset of road signs.

## Tutorial about classification with mljs

mljs is a library of Machine Learning which includes many classifiers. My tutorial shows how to use some of these classifiers so try to solve a problem of leaf classification.
